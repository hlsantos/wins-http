<p>This system uses "session cookies" as a way to log into the system.
There are two types of cookies; session and permanent:
</p>

<p><b>Permanent cookies</b> is the one most people are concern about.
Web sites (like advertisers) who use permanent cookies leave a <font
color='red'>"piece of user tracking information"</font> about yourself on
your computer. You need to manually clear cookies to remove the
permanent cookies or you can disable permanent cookies in your browser.</p>

<p><b>Session cookies</b> are considered less intrusive on your privacy as they
are only alive or active while the browser remains open. Session cookies are
automatically deleted when you close the browser. Session cookies
are used by this system for the sole purpose of logging in and out of the
system.  No private or tracking information is stored on your hard drive. </p>
